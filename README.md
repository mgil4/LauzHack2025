# LauzHack2025
This project leverages **state-of-the-art visual language models** (QWEN2-VL) and **agentic frameworks** (LangGraph) to monitor a home in real time. The system can:

- Detect people approaching the door and classify them as **residents**, **routine visitors** (e.g., mail carriers), or **suspicious activities**.  
- Convert **voice inputs** into Google Calendar events using **Whisper** and a small **LLM**, tracking expected return times.  
- Send **Telegram alerts** for both:  
  - People approaching the door, and  
  - Missed deadlines when a resident has not returned as expected.
